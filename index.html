			<p>&quot;After about 10 years of social smoking, I felt like I wanted some control back in my life.  I went to see Justine Magill of New Leaf Healing a little unsure of what to expect as I had never been hypnotised before.  I was actually surprised at how enjoyable the experience was and how relaxing it felt.  After the therapy, I had a strong sense of self control and strength unfamiliar to me.  Even after drinking I was able to stop from smoking.  It is incredibly effective, much more successful than patches or other nicotine related controls on the market which don't suit social smokers.</p> 
            <p>I have since recommended New Leaf Healing to many friends who have also stopped smoking for more than 12 months now. I honestly recommend giving it a go - it's the best thing you'll ever do for your health.&quot;</p>

			<h1>What is Hypnosis and how does it work?</h1>

			<p><strong>Hypnotherapy is an exciting and positive way to help you improve your life!</strong></p>
			<p>So what is hypnosis exactly?  It is an altered state of awareness where you feel completely relaxed mentally, physically and emotionally.  It is similar to daydreaming - you experience deep relaxation, while your mind is still alert to your physical sensations and surroundings.</p>
			<p>Hypnotherapists use this altered (or hypnotic) state to facilitate communication between the conscious and subconscious minds.  The conscious (analytical) mind enjoys a break, while your subconscious mind is open and receptive to positive commands and suggestions.  The result is you are able to make positive changes to thought patterns, habits and overcome fears that negatively impact your life.</p>
			<p>During hypnosis your own abilities are enhanced.  For example, you are better able to imagine, remember and use your creativity which all support in creating changes.</p>
			<p>Hypnosis is safe and you are always in control.  Generally, clients find it to be a very pleasant and relaxing experience.</p>
			<p>Hypnotherapy has had proven success with many issues, in particular:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="list_text">stop smoking</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">weight loss</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">stress and anxiety</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">sleeping patterns</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">nail biting</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">pregnancy/birthing</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">phobias and fears</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">confidence and motivation</span></li>
				<li><span class="list_text">study and recall</span></li>

			<h1>Herbal Medicine</h1>

			<p>Herbal medicine has been used for centuries and is widely used throughout the world. </p>
			<p>Using the healing properties of plants, herbal medicine is effective in treating a range of ailments, as well as improving overall health.  Herbal medicine is holistic - treating the cause of the underlying problem and restoring health.</p>
			<p>Herbs can be used to treat acute conditions, such as colds and flu, as they are readily absorbed into the bloodstream providing you with fast results.  Chronic conditions also respond well to herbal medicine, although you could expect to take treatment for up to 4-6 weeks.</p>
			<p>A full case history is taken, ensuring that any underlying problems are identified.  A specialised treatment plan is then designed and implemented, with all herbal formulas being prepared according to the specific needs of each client and administered with clear dosage instructions.  Follow-up consultations are available to monitor progress and ensure best results.</p>
